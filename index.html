                        <p class="lead">
                            Welcome to my software portfolio! I'm a passionate developer with a strong background in creating innovative solutions and building robust applications.
                            With nearly 15 years of experience across a wide variety of languages, frameworks, technologies, and industries, I have done a little bit of everything 🙂.
                            I thrive in environments that provide autonomy and ownership. I like to have decision-making power and prefer not to have my hand held.
                            I like to ship fast, but also enjoy optimizing code and writing thorough unit test coverage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not building or learning, I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities including hiking, camping, off-road motorcycling, and paddleboarding.
                            I also enjoy studying and playing tournament poker.
                        </p>

                                    What began as a side project—building small business websites and custom Shopify stores—grew into a full-time venture. Since then,
                                    I’ve led and delivered a wide variety of projects, including serving as a technical lead for globally distributed teams across multiple organizations.
                                    Starting and growing my own consulting business has been one of the most rewarding and impactful decisions of my career.

                                <p class="card-text">As a lead engineer on the architecture team, I led many projects in a large-scale cloud transition.
                                    Delegating work to 50+ engineers, I helped to shape internal policies, build internal tooling, and migrate several applications to modern tech stacks.
                                    I designed databases, built API’s using .NET, integrated with third party API’s, and built Angular web applications.
                                    I started at Tyler as a product team software engineer, where I worked on a variety of products and collaborated directly with support, QA, and clients.
                                    I was promoted to Lead Software Engineer after about 3 years, and shortly after that, moved to the architecture team to help lead cloud migration efforts.

                                    Approximately 13 hours per day, 6 days per week, for 14 weeks. A mix of hands-on building and theory.

                            For the majority of my career, I have worked on enterprise software and proprietary systems that cannot be easily shared publicly, or require licenses to access.
                            I have also worked on a handful of personal projects, some of which I can provide video demos for, and some of which are accessible on the internet.
                            Below, I will share as many resources as I can to showcase my work. I'll start with what I have been up to lately, and work backwards.

                                    This was a solo developer project done through my own LLC.
                                    I built a custom Shopify app that integrates with Keystroke PoS systems to provide bi-directional syncing.
                                    This project also involved a second app which is a .NET C# API running as a Windows Service, responsible for
                                    receiving Shopify order data on the Keystroke side to update Keystroke with new orders and inventory changes.
                                    This app is not publicly accessible and I am not able to share the proprietary codebase, but below are some screenshots of
                                    both the Shopify app and the UI for the .NET API Windows Service.
                                    This product has been launched and is installed for two large distributors in the US, with more installations pending.

                                    For about a year, I worked as a tech lead with a large, globally distributed team to help rebuild a legacy surgical software application.
                                    This product is used by eye surgeons to plan and simulate implantable lens surgeries, and to order appropriate lenses for patients.
                                    It is a novel combination of eCommerce and medical device software. I worked heavily on the back end and cloud infrastructure, and delegated work to
                                    a small team of engineers. I also worked closely with a third-party team from the engineering firm Deloitte, as they were building out an Oracle data backend

                                    While at Tyler Technologies, I worked on a number of products. The biggest one was Enterprise ERP, the company's flagship product.
                                    I started out as a product team engineer working on HR, payroll, risk management, and benefits modules. This was a full-stack role.
                                    I built and optmized SQL queries, designed schemas, and worked heavily on API's and business logic. I also did a significant amount of front-end work,
                                    both creating new features and modules, and fixing lots of bugs in existing modules. I worked directly with many stakeholders, including support,
                                    QA, senior management, and clients. I started out as a junior engineer, and was promoted to lead engineer after about 3 years (which is very fast and uncommon for this company).
                                    I skipped over the senior engineer level, and went straight to lead engineer. Eventually, I transitioned into a lead archetcture engineer position, where I shifted my focus to
                                    cloud infrastructure, internal tooling, and leading cloud migration efforts.

                                    I am very proud of this project - it involved designing and building a fully automated manufacturing line from the ground up,
                                    replacing a failing legacy system with no documentation. I designed the entire control system, including PLC programming, HMI design,
                                    and integration with various third party software for acoustic analysis and solenoid control. This new system improved upon the old one in many ways:
                                    50% improvement in throughput, uses off-the-shelf parts to make it more robust and maintainable, and has great documentation!

                                    My favorite thing to do is build things. I love creating new software, because I get to build my own little world.
                                    I thrive in environments providing autonomy and ownership, and don't do well with micromanagement and hand holding. I like having decision making power.
                                    I like to ship fast, and believe that the pursuit of perfection can sometimes be the enemy of completing something that is good enough.
                                    I am perfectly happy to ship code that is not perfect, and to optimize later, using an iterative process.
                                    I respect timelines and requirements, and while I have a great attention to detail - I know when to prioritize speed over perfection.
                                    Having said that, optimizing code and improving efficiency are also activities I find to be very enjoyable.
                                    In December 2025, I completed a <a href="https://www.thinkherrmann.com/whole-brain-thinking-blog/work-style-assessment/" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">Work Style assessment</a> customized for software engineers, and learned that I lean heavily towards being a <strong>Producer</strong>,
                                    while also having a preference towards <strong>Innovation</strong>. I found this to be very accurate, and the results are shown below:

                                <p class="card-text">Hi! 👋 I'm Doug. I'm a 37-year-old software engineer with a broad background.
                                    When I'm not coding, building, or learning, I'm usually either doing something outside (hiking is my favorite), or playing poker.
                                    I live in Hallowell, Maine with my wife Olivia and our cat Chandler (dog coming soon!). I love our little city. It's charming, walkable, and has a great community.
                                    We are fortunate to have access to many beautiful hiking trails and local ponds, a vibrant music and art scene, great food, and a wonderful group of close friends.
                                </p>
