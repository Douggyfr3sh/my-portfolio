# Software Portfolio

This is my personal software development portfolio. I created it from a publicly available [boilerplate repository I created](https://github.com/Douggyfr3sh/software-portfolio), which you can use to create your own portfolio!

The `index.html` file contains the full portfolio, including:
- Work History
- Education
- Portfolio (Samples of work)
- Work Style
- Hobbies
- Personal Info

This portfolion uses Bootstrap via a CDN for styling and layout.
