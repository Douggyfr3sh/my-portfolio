# AI Agent Instructions for Software Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This is a simple HTML-based software portfolio website using Bootstrap 5 for styling and layout. The site is designed to showcase a developer's professional information, work history, education, projects, and personal details.

## Current Structure
- **index.html**: Main portfolio page with Bootstrap CDN integration
- **Sections**:
  - Top navigation bar with site title
  - About Me section with profile image placeholder and description
  - Tabbed navigation for different portfolio sections

## Key Technologies
- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5.3.2 (CSS Framework via CDN)
- Vanilla JavaScript (through Bootstrap bundle)

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Content
1. **Work History Tab**: Add professional experience with company names, roles, dates, and descriptions
2. **Education Tab**: Include degrees, certifications, courses, and relevant educational background
3. **Portfolio Tab**: Showcase projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links
4. **Work Style Tab**: Describe working methodologies, preferred tools, and collaboration style
5. **Hobbies Tab**: Personal interests that might be relevant to professional development
6. **Personal Info Tab**: Contact information, location, availability status

### Code Standards
- Use Bootstrap classes for consistent styling
- Keep responsive design in mind (mobile-first approach)
- Maintain semantic HTML structure
- Use Bootstrap components where applicable
- Keep custom CSS minimal and well-documented

### Image Integration
- The profile image placeholder (400x400px black box) should be replaced with:
  - A data URI image, or
  - A reference to an uploaded image file
- Consider using Bootstrap's image classes for responsive behavior

### Future Enhancements
- Add smooth scrolling navigation
- Include contact form functionality
- Add project image galleries
- Implement dark/light theme toggle
- Add animations or transitions
- Include social media links
- Add downloadable resume feature
